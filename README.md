## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I did this project to polish my vanilla js skills and I have to admit I learnt a lot while building this project. It may not be perfect, but I completed most of the challenge. First of all managing states, conditional rendering in vanilla javascript seems like a big task, but I'm very happy I was able to pull it off! And yes I couldn't make it responsive, I'm not a CSS guru lol.

### Continued development

I could do a better job in rendering I guess, right now it's a very hacky way to render since I'm adding new elements to the dom over and over, you can only go so far without any libraries though.
